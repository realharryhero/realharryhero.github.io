# L1 OpenCompass Homework for LLM Practical Camp Course (InternLM-1.8b)

I reused the llamaindex environment from the LlamaIndex RAG assignment. Format is from top to bottom, with recording at the end.

First, I installed the OpenCompass package. After keyboard interrupting as I didn't activate the llamaindex environment, I obtained the following installation result:

Then I unzipped the dataset containing the files (top of picture), and for some reason `pip install -e .` installed everything but opencompass, so I re-ran that command to list all the configurations of models:

Then, after keyboard interrupting to record, I started evaluating with OpenCompass:

This recording is rather long; it's stopped midway. Note a small popup on the middle-right at some point in the video (I'm only recording a part of my screen and doing other InternLM-related stuff on the other part):

      <source src="../opencompass-video.mov" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
~~~

The end result: (note my directory structure's just "root" as I lost connection when the time until shutdown ran out)

And that's all!
