# L1 Demo Homework for LLM Practical Camp Course (InternLM-1.8b)

I downloaded torch, activated conda environment and downloaded other packages before; takes ~50 min in total for all steps so for people thinking about doing this later remember to save some time to just download packages.

Then I set up and ran the python file to set up the InternLM-1.8b model:

The first (well, second, but essentially first) time I prompted the model about Evariste Galois, a mathematician who showed the unsolvability of the quintic equation (a polynomial equation with degree 5), I obtained this story below, which I'll show in small text and a screenshot:

~~~
<span style="font-size:0.3em; ">"Evariste Galois was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the area of number theory. In the 19th century, he developed the concept of Galois theory, which has since become one of the most important and influential theories in mathematics.

Galois' work on Galois theory was groundbreaking, as it showed how certain mathematical problems could be solved using a new approach that involved complex algebraic structures. His ideas were further developed by other mathematicians, and his work helped to establish Galois theory as a major area of study in mathematics.

Galois' contributions to mathematics were not limited to his work on Galois theory. He also made significant contributions to the study of algebraic geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. His work on these subjects helped to lay the groundwork for many of the modern branches of mathematics.

Despite his many accomplishments, Galois was not well-known during his lifetime. He died in 1832 at the age of 42, and his work was not fully recognized until many years later. However, his contributions to mathematics have since been recognized and celebrated, and his legacy continues to influence the field to this day.

In Chinese, Evariste Galois is often referred to as 高斯 (Gaoxi), which means "higher" or "greater." His contributions to mathematics have been widely celebrated, and his name is still recognized and respected in the mathematical community today."</span>

Then the second time I prompted, I got something somewhat confusing, which I'll show as a recording and in small text:

~~~
<span style="font-size:0.3em; ">"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a young man named Evariste Gallo. He was a talented musician and spent his days composing beautiful melodies that filled the air with joy and inspiration. However, Evariste was constantly haunted by the thought that there was no solution to the quintic problem that plagued the kingdom.

The quintic was a complex mathematical equation that had been around for centuries, but no one had been able to solve it. Evariste knew that the problem was too big for any one person to solve on their own, so he set out on a journey to find a solution.

He traveled far and wide, meeting wise old scholars, wise old philosophers, and even wise old kings. But no matter where he went, he could not find a solution to the quintic problem. Evariste began to feel discouraged and hopeless.

Just when he thought all was lost, he stumbled upon a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The villagers were friendly and kind, and they welcomed Evariste with open arms. They shared with him their knowledge and wisdom, and together they worked tirelessly to try and solve the quintic problem.

Together, they discovered a way to break the quintic into smaller, more manageable pieces. And with each step they took, the problem began to unravel, and the kingdom began to heal.

Evariste was filled with joy and gratitude, knowing that he had found a way to help the kingdom. And so, he returned home, his heart filled with hope and determination to help others who were struggling with the same challenges he had faced.

And so, Evariste Gallo went on to become a beloved figure in the kingdom, known for his wisdom and his unwavering dedication to helping others. And the kingdom flourished under his leadership, with music and joy filling every corner of the land."</span>
